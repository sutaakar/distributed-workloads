       "\n",
       "The practice of mumming cats was particularly common for family pets. When a family cat died, the family would mourn by shaving off their eyebrows and holding elaborate funerals. During these ceremonies, they would drink wine and beat their breasts, symbolizing grief. The embalmed cat, along with a tiny mummy of a mouse (to represent the cat's prey), was then placed in the family tomb or in a pet cemetery.\n",

This event highlights the historical significance and practical use of cat mummies in ancient Egypt.\n",
